# Final Project
In this final project, we were given the freedom to use any machine learning algorithm learned in the class to solve our choice of problem in groups of two. I decided to work on this on my own to give myself a clear understanding of the entirety of the project I decided to do. In this case, I used bagged ensemble trees as a means to classify websites as being phishing sites or not. For more details into the project, take a look at [the project PDF](cs559_hojustin_project.pdf). Implemented in MatLab.
