# CS-576 - Systems Security
This class focused upon the foundations and applications of various common security exploits and bugs within C code, like return-oriented programming and return-to-libc attacks. There was also a third assignment and a final project, but since I completed these with a team, I decided to withhold them.

This class mostly saw use of Python, with a small sprinkle of Assembly to create shellcode.
