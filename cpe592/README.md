# CPE-592 - Computer and Multimedia Network Security
This class focused on discussing a number of various security topics across multimedia platforms, like encryption and media (like images, videos, and movies) watermarking. This class also had a second assignment and a final project, but since they are traditional papers, I decided not to include them.

In this class, we had the choice to use any programming language we so desired. I used Python as my language.
